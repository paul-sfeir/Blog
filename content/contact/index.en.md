Starting the mid-November 2021 and until end of November 2022 you can contact me either by email:
<a href="mailto:paul.sfeir@kerguelen.ipev.fr">paul.sfeir@kerguelen.ipev.fr</a> 

Or by normal mail:

{{< highlight html >}}
Paul SFEIR
Base de Port aux Français
District de KERGUELEN
Terres Australes et Antarctiques Françaises
Via 97408 St DENIS MESSAGERIE
REUNION
{{< /highlight >}}

If you are to choose the second method (That would be a good surprise), stamp it as you would to send it to la Réunion and do not ask for a delivery receipt.

Please pay attention not to send by inadvertence any seeds or insects that could harm the fragile ecosystem.

Finally, as the mail can take a few months to reach me, if you were to send a package with food (it is never forbidden to dream), please avoid food that do not age well / cannot handle the heat :wink:

In order to motivate you to send me letters, I commit myself to send back a nice postcard with a beautiful stamp from the local post office (and mine too)
